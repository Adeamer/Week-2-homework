# Professional Portfolio

```
Please see the below how the acceptance creiteria was met:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work, WHEN I load their portfolio, THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them: I added my profile picture wich was added into the head throught <img> and src tags.

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section: This was done by adding a href to each navigation tag to the the id of the <div>.

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications: This was also done by the href that was put in the header for the <nav>.

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application, THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others: this was done by adding various CSS properties like "opacity", "box-shadow", "transform" and changing the cursor to a pointer.

WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application: this was done by adding a href with a link to the wedsite I worked on.

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport: This was done by adding @media queries and moving each part to fit and work for each device.

Note: I tried to made drop down box for tablets and mob mobile devices but couldnt figure out how to make the box work when click to show the drop down menu. I found a usefull video that does it with just CSS but I had no luck with finding the correct path for the :checked tag.
